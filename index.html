                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p> Hello! My name is Fatima Rodriguez. I am a graduate student at Northern Illinois University studying particle physics. My interests include finding physics beyond the standard model, skateboarding, cooking, playing videogames, reading, talking to friends, and creating this website. As a first-gen student in physics, I created this website with the intention to provide resources for other students navigating the physics world (and also for fun blogs). Please feel free to browse around! </p>

                    <h3> Research Journey </h3>
                    <p> For my first project, I studied muon detection and production at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with Dr. Spencer Klein. I investigated which type of two collisions that occur in the atmosphere is the dominant source of muon production using a Monte-Carlo simulation. I taught myself C++ and the software ROOT from CERN. I presented my results at the 2021 Virtual Statewide CAMP Symposium, where I was awarded the Special Research Merit Award and Best Video Award for my poster titled, “Ultra-Peripheral Collisions vs. Hadronic Collisions: A Comparison of Muon Production.” This experience sparked an interest in writing simulations to answer astrophysical questions beyond cosmic rays. My presentation on this research can be found in the video below. </p>

                    <p> The following summer, I did research under Dr. Shen at UC Berkeley’s Astronomy Department to begin writing my own simulations and provide evidence for dynamically driven double-degenerate double detonation (D^6) scenarios. This project aimed to determine how many hypervelocity white dwarf stars (WD) are observable if D^6 scenarios exist by building a Monte-Carlo simulation in Python. I also taught myself SQL to collect data from the Gaia mission and search for the resulting WDs. We were not successful in finding the resulting WDs, but it was exhilarating working with observational data and comparing it to simulation results. I questioned if the results were not due to a failure in theory, but due to a missed statistical error, which began a new interest in data analysis. </p>
                    <p> My interest in data analysis led me to work with Prof. Bloom to study cataclysmic variables (CVs), binary star systems, in NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. I queried through TESS data to find potential CVs and studied their time-domain properties using Lomb-Scargle periodograms to bring insight into accretion physics and potentially constrain evolutionary models. I distinguished potential CV candidates by writing my own data analysis script in Python and used photometry to clean the observations from any systematic uncertainties. After the summer, I was promoted to Staff Research Associate for the remaining year. This project solidified my practice of the scientific method in obtaining data, questioning observations, and applying statistical methods to produce quality results. </p>
                    <p> I was then selected by the GEM Fellowship and Dr. Kiburg from Fermilab to intern for the Muon g-2 experiment. My project was to determine the background radial magnetic field using data analysis and design a platform using CAD that mounts a Hall probe and directly measures the radial field. In November 2022, I was invited back to Muon g-2 as an Engineering Physicist for a year. Since then, I’ve performed a new radial field scan, which I’ll be analyzing with ROOT and comparing with results from the summer. I also presented feasibility studies on a new method of mapping the radial field during the winter collaboration meeting. My results are serving as a guideline for upcoming radial field measurements. The opportunity to work with an operating experiment has also allowed me to participate in data-taking shifts. I’ve learned that I’m most engaged when bouncing off ideas with other collaborators because I’m guaranteed to learn something new from either the experiment’s history or hardware. Creating new methods to minimize uncertainties is very thrilling. I’m convinced that my passion lies in experimental physics. </p>
                    <p> I am now studying at Northern Illinois University with Professor Hector de la Torre Perez and Dr. Walter Hopkins at Argonne National Laboratory for the Chicagoland Computational Traineeship in High Energy Particle Physics (C^2-theP^2 Program). Under this program, I work on testing the next evolution of TTree known as RNTuple in physics analysis workflows used in the ATLAS collaboration. RNTuple is expected to reduce both the disk space usage of HEP data as well as increase the data throughput when compared to TTree, Parquet, and HDF5. The RNTuple format is currently still under development and is expected to roll out at the start of the HL-LHC. My goal is to identify any improvements for the end-user experience and suggest any changes to the format.</p>

                <h2>From Heartbreak to Death</h2>
                <p> If I had to choose a word to describe this past year and a half, it's grief. First, my then boyfriend experienced a loss. Then one of my best friends experienced loss. Then another best friend did too. I learned that a past classmate passed away. Another best friend experienced loss. Later, another did too. </p>
                <p> I’ve never been confronted by death before this past year, and frankly, I wasn’t sure how to best support my friends through it. How much time do I give them to grieve on their own? Is that the right approach? Do I bring it up or do I wait for them to? How do I bring it up? Are they eating? </p>
                <p> When I learned my past classmate passed away, I sobbed, and that shocked me. We weren’t particularly close. I haven't spoken to them in years. And yet remembering how kind they always were during the few moments we had together, made me cry. It put into perspective the amount of grief that my friends were experiencing due to their personal losses. Something I still can’t even imagine. </p>
                <p> Switching gears, I am currently going through heartbreak. I’m embarrassed to say, but it's been 6+ months since my ex and I broke up, and I am still learning how to move forward. To be fair, it’s been a roller coaster of emotions where some days I’m completely fine and other times I find myself paralyzed and sobbing. The time it's been since the break and the amount of time I’ve continued to cry makes me feel all kinds of crazy, cliche, cringy - all around embarrassed and frustrated. So being the scientist that I am, I wanted to learn the science behind heartbreak. Is there even science behind it? Why does it hurt so much? And when will it stop? </P>
                <p> I came across a Science Vs. episode by Spotify Studios [2]. The episode talked about the research done at Albert Einstein College of Medicine by Dr. Lucy Brown, where they essentially took a bunch of broken hearted students and made them stare at a picture of their exes inside an MRI. What their brain scans revealed is that the part of the brain that signals physical pain was active, yet seeing the picture of their exes also activated another part of the brain, which they call the reward system - the part that triggers after eating chocolate, doing drugs, when in love, etc. So what this means is that during heartbreak, our brains are literally hurting, and that triggers down to our bodies. Coincidentally, I had a doctor's appointment this morning because my menstrual cycle was out of whack and it never does that (sorry kinda personal for the first blog, but also, half the world have cycles - grow up). My doctor explained that the main reason a woman’s menstrual cycle can go out of whack is emotional stress/turmoil .“Are you traveling a lot recently? Going through a breakup or changing your eating habits? “, she asks. “Ha ha…no”. </p>
                <p> After listening to the podcast and reflecting on the unusual behaviors of my body, I felt scared because the brain is such a powerful, unknown organ, but also relieved that my body was just responding properly to my grief. </p>
                <p> Grief. After supporting my friends through their grief of losing someone close, it feels extremely wrong and dramatic calling my emotions after this break up, “grief”. I talked to my best friend about this, one who experienced a close death, and she mentioned a similar research she came across done to study grief [1] (she is also a girly in STEM , btw). It was the same process: they placed folks who recently experienced loss into an MRI and studied their brain behavior. Similar brain behavior occurred as described in the heartbreak podcast. That’s when we came into the realization that grief is a spectrum. At first, “grief” is a single-used word to describe emotions caused after someone’s death. But now, I think grief is a spectrum of emotions caused by loss. All kinds of loss. My ex was my best friend. My person. I knew everything about him and his whereabouts. He knew mine. But now that type of relationship is gone. I don’t know where he’s at, and I’m not sure if I truly know him at all anymore. The person he was to me and that had brought me joy is gone, and that’s what my body is grieving. A very different grief, to be clear, from what he and my friends are or were feeling.</p>
                <p> That being said, it hasn’t been the best of times being a bunch of twenty year olds navigating loss. Why is it such a sad time? Is this a general mid-twenties experience? Just something I continue thinking about. </p>
